# Locations Entities Project

You are a new employee with the Commonwealth of Viriginia in the new GeoLocation Division.  The GeoLocation Division is responsible for situational awareness of all citites, towns, major landmarks, and places within the Commonwealth.  This information is then shared within other agencies and to the citizens of Virginia.  Information comes from a variety of sources including social media, state employee reports, and various news outlets.  

The GeoLocation Division has had a difficult time wrangling all this data together and distributing it in an efficient matter.  The data sets are strewn across many different tools and it takes on average 30 minutes for a single analyst to retrieve all the data on a single location for a given timeframe.  

The GeoLocation Division has commissioned the creation of the Location Entity System (LES) to colligate(A) these data sets into a single repository.  The objective is to reduce the time it takes an analyst to find any information on a location by 50% threshold, 90% objective.  

You are responsible for the beta release of the back end for this system using MarkLogic.  You will combine several data sources including a state gazateer, social media, and predefined data into a Location Entity black box.  

# Requirements

1) As an analyst, I want to combine two location entities into one, so that I can reduce the number of duplicate location entities in the system. 

2) As an analyst, I want to constrain my search by location name, so that I can find all source reports related to a location.

3) As an analyst, I want to constrain my search by event date, so that I can constrain my search between two dates
